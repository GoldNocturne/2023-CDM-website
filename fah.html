    <p>Fear &amp; Hunger is a game made in RPG maker, and a hybrid of several genres, including horror, RPG, and dungeon-crawler (if you take that literally). It was developed by Miro Haverinen and published by Happy Paintings in 2018.</p>

<smalltext>The game has a hauntingly beautiful art style that is immediately apparent looking at the human characters.  </smalltext>

    <p>You spend about a minute out front of the dungeons searching the barrels and crates for items and familiarising yourself with the environment. The game warns you that <q>you can hear distant barking from afar</q>, and you suppose that is a reminder to get a move on. You're suddenly assaulted by several dogs, and they're faster than you.</p></article>

    <p>It's alright, you think. This is probably a tutorial battle. But it's not alright! The hounds are strong, and you're probably infected, dead, or on the verge of death. Around this point, I've watched people uninstall Fear &amp; Hunger for being cruel, annoying or unfair. And in some ways, it is that. There's more.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have three status bars to keep track of. Body, your physical health  points. Mind, which doubles both as your magic points and remaining sanity. And hunger, which can cripple you if you get too hungry. The beginning of this game is overwhelming. It's difficult, and confusing, and you might wonder what kind of person derives enjoyment from this BS.</p>

    <p>The trick to this game is that if you play the opening of this game the way most RPGs are played (AKA engaging in turn-based combat and expecting any kind of reward), you will not have a good time. You're weak, insignificant. Resources are limited. You can lose limbs and contract fatal status effects in battle. You gain almost nothing from defeating enemies. No EXP, sometimes a couple of items, but nowhere near the amount you lose. The best outcome in most cases is to avoid combat entirely.</p>
