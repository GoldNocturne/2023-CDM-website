        <h1>Welcome to Rokkenjima.</h1>
	<p>The Golden Witch extends you her heartfelt greetings.</p>
	<p>Before anything else, please make yourself at home.</p> 
	<p>There is nothing to think too deeply about.</p>
    <p>Just be silent and take in the events,</p>
    <p>in their entirety, as they unfold.</p>
    <p>That is all that is asked of you.</p>
    <p>The difficulty level is standard.</p>
    <p>Let us at least begin on the trodden road.</p>

<p>Umineko When They Cry is a murder mystery visual novel with writing and original spriting by Ryukishi07. It also boasts a robust original soundtrack (200 songs) worked on by various artists. It conveys its story through text-based narration, supplemented by on-screen visuals and accompanying music, focusing on the obscenely wealthy Ushiromiya family, who gather once a year for a family conference on the patriarch's private island.</p>
    <p>Umineko is primarily known for two things. One is that it's well-written, and from experience most people come out of it saying it changed their perspective on human connection in some way.</p>
    <p>The other is that it's extremely long. For more information about exactly how long it is, here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/TdzOeRVbk5I">helpful video</a> by the YouTube content creator Red Bard. </p>

        <h3>The witch's epitaph</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.</p>
    <p>You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.</p>
    <p>As you travel down it, you will see a village.</p>
    <p>In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.</p>
    <p>There sleeps the key to the Golden Land.</p>
    <p>The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules.</p>
    <p>On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices.</p>
    <p>On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.</p>
    <p>On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name.</p>
    <p>On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.</p>
    <p>On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.</p>
    <p>On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.</p>
    <p>On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.</p>
    <p>On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.</p>
    <p>On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive.</p>
    <p>On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures,</p>
    <p>once and for the last time.</p>
<p>The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures.</p>
    <p>One shall be all the gold from the Golden Land.</p>
    <p>One shall be the resurrection of all the dead souls.</p>
    <p>One shall be the resurrection of the love that was lost.</p>
    <p>One shall be to put the witch to sleep for all time.</p>
    <p>Sleep peacefully, my beloved witch, Beatrice.  </p>
